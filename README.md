The tent map is a piecewise linear, one-dimensional map.
            
           Functions:
            Main function                : main.m
            Tent map function            : tent.m
            Finding the minimum value    : minm.m
            

Tent map is a real-valued function fμ defined by

                                    fμ = μ ∗ min {x, 1 − x} 
Here the parameter μ is a positive real constant whose value ranges in the interval [0, 2]. The name Tent map is due to its tent-like structure of the graph defined by fμ.

Input the value to x and a;

             x=  ; % Initial values
             a=  ; % Parameter value
